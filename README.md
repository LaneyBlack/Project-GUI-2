Cards Opening Game (JFX) - Semester Project on GUI and OOP in Java (PJATK) 
2nd Semester Project

This was the last semester project on this subject.
It features a momory game where you have to open same cards at the same move (the should be a even number of cards of course).
Project features a welcome menu:

a highscore menu, where you can sort player scores by columns and scroll the highscore table:

and a game menu that starts with a countdown, so the player can memorise all the cards:

I used OOP, multithreading and Jfx in creation of this project.
